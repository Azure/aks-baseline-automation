# IaC
This folder contains IaC code for bicep and terraform and instructions on how to deploy the [AKS Baseline Reference Implementation](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline) using either of the two languages:
* Deployment using [bicep](./IaC/../bicep/README.md)
* Deployment using [terraform](./IaC/../terraform/README.md)

After the deployment of the cluster, you can [validate](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline/blob/main/11-validation.md) it and then when you are done you can [clean it up](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline/blob/main/12-cleanup.md).
