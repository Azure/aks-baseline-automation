# Shared-Services - Workflow

This scenario deploys Shared services through a CI/CD pipeline.


## Overview

The GitHub action workflow [Shared-Services-HelmDeployNginx.yaml](../.github/workflows/Shared-Services-HelmDeployNginx.yaml) is used to to deploy a shared service: NGINX. Note that we could have picked traefik or any other shared service for this purpose.
