# Shared Services
This folder contains manifest files and other artifacts to deploy common services used across multiple clusters and multiple applications.

Example of shared services could be third-party services such as [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v1.7/user-guide/kubernetes/?msclkid=2309fcb3b1bc11ec92c03b099f5d4e1c), [Prisma defender](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud) and [Splunk](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-kubernetes) or open source services such as [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/kubernetes-ingress-controller), [KEDA](https://keda.sh), [External-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns#:~:text=ExternalDNS%20supports%20multiple%20DNS%20providers%20which%20have%20been,and%20we%20have%20limited%20resources%20to%20test%20changes.), [Cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) or [Istio](https://istio.io/).


This **shared-services** directory is the root of the GitOps configuration directory. The Kubernetes manifest files included in the subdirectories are expected to be deployed via our in-cluster Flux operator. They are our AKS cluster's baseline configurations. The Flux operator is bootstrapped as part of the cluster deployment through the bicep or terraform IaC workflows.

The **namespaces** directory contains the configuration for each namespace and the resources created under those namespaces:

* Namespace **cluster-baseline-settings**: 
  * [Kured](#kured)
  * Azure AD Pod Identity
  * Kubernetes RBAC Role Assignments through Azure AD Groups (_optional_)
* Namespace: **kube-system**:
  * Azure Monitor Prometheus Scraping
* Namespace: **traefik**:
  * Ingress Controller [Traefik](#Traefik)
* Namespace: **a0008**:
  * Ingress Network Policy
  * RBAC settings specific to this namespace (_optional_)

The first three namespaces are workload agnostic and tend to all cluster-wide configuration concerns, while the forth one is workload specific. Typically, workload specific configuration settings are controlled by the application teams through their own GitHub repos and GitOps solution, which may be different from Flux used here to configure the cluster.

The **cluster** directory contains the configuration that applies to entire cluster (such as ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding), rather than to individual namespaces.

## Private bootstrapping repository

Typically, your bootstrapping repository wouldn't be a public facing repository like this one, but instead a private GitHub or an Azure DevOps repo. The Flux operator deployed with the cluster supports private git repositories as your bootstrapping source. In addition to requiring network line of sight to the repository from your cluster's nodes, you'll also need to ensure that you've provided the necessary credentials. This can come, typically, in the form of certificate based SSH or personal access tokens (PAT), both ideally scoped as read-only to the repo with no additional permissions.

To configure the settings for the GitHub repo that you want flux to pull from, update the cluster parameter file in your forked repo prior to deploying it:
* If you are using terraform modify the [`flux.yaml`](../../IaC/terraform/configuration/workloads/flux.tfvars) file.
* If you are using bicep modify the [`cluster.parameters.json`](../../IaC/bicep/rg-spoke/cluster.parameters.json) file.
  
## Traefik
To deploy traefik into your cluster through GitOps using flux follow these steps:

1. Import the Traefik container image to your container registry if it was not imported through the IaC GitHub workflow:
   
   ```bash
   # Import ingress controller image hosted in public container registries
   az acr import --source docker.io/library/traefik:v2.8.1 -n $ACR_NAME_AKS_BASELINE
   ```
2. Rename and customize the following files in the github repo that you forked from this repo.  
* **azureidentity.yaml.template** needs to be renamed to azureidentity.yaml and the following parameters set in this file based on your specific environment:
  *  ${TRAEFIK_USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID}
  *  ${TRAEFIK_USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID}
* **secretproviderclass.yaml.template** needs to be renamed to secretproviderclass.yaml and the following parameters set:
  * ${KEYVAULT_NAME_AKS_BASELINE}
  * ${TENANTID_AZURERBAC_AKS_BASELINE}
* **traefik.yaml.template** needs to be renamed to traefik.yaml the following parameters set:
  * ${ACR_NAME_AKS_BASELINE}

Note that most of the parameters requested above will only be available to you after the deployment of your cluster.

## Kured

Kured is included as a solution to handle occasional required reboots from daily OS patching. No customization is required for this service to get it started.
This open-source software component is only needed if you require a managed rebooting solution between weekly [node image upgrades](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/node-image-upgrade). Building a process around deploying node image upgrades [every week](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases) satisfies most organizational weekly patching cadence requirements. Combined with most security patches on Linux not requiring reboots often, this leaves your cluster in a well supported state. If weekly node image upgrades satisfies your business requirements, then remove Kured from this solution by deleting [`kured.yaml`](./cluster-baseline-settings/kured.yaml). If however weekly patching using node image upgrades is not sufficient and you need to respond to daily security updates that mandate a reboot ASAP, then using a solution like Kured will help you achieve that objective. 

Note that the image for kured is sourced from a public registry and should be changed to your local registry in the **kured.yaml** file prior to use in your environment.
